# Password Generator
A simple password generator made with C# as well as a separate Python release. Feel free to implement this in anything you want :)

Currently the generator only works by generating a set number of random characters (chosen by user input), there is no option to include or exclude particular character types (such as upper case, numbers, symbols, etc). However I will try to make this possible another time.
I'm aware this code might not be the greatest either so make any changes you need to.
